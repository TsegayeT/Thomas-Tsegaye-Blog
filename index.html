      <h3><a class ="header-link" href="https://github.com/TsegayeT/Celtics-analysis/blob/main/Tatum_Distribution">Tatum Stats Distribution</a></h3>

        <p>Tatum stats having been going in the right direction over his career. His Points, TS, and eFG have a wider distribution in 2022 season because <br>
        he started off shooting bad in the first few months of the season. Tatum picked it up in Jan 2022 and has been on fire since. He is now a top 5 MVP <br>
        candidate. The encouraging sign is that his USG has increased a lot but his eFG and TS hasnt dropped. This shows he can be a heliocentric player, <br>
        having the offense run through him. On top of that his Assists and Total Rebounding are increasing, making him a complete player. He is also a great<br>
        defender, on and off ball. Click on the header for the code in my Github.</p>

    <h3> <u>Youtube: Frank Pepe's Pizzeria Review, Bethesda MD</u></h3>
      <p>This pizza spot is located in at the mall in Bethesda. It is a famous pizza spot from the Pizza Capital, New Haven CT. I was concerned that it was inside the mall and<br>
      my concerns were valid because the pizza disappointed. It was still good but I imagine the original is a lot better. I loved the crust, especially the burnt parts.</p>

    <h3> <u>Youtube: Giuseppi's Pizza Plus Review, Rockville MD</u></h3>
      <p>This pizza spot is located in a great area with a theater right next to it and other restaurants as well.
      Parking spots and garage right next to it. The wings were actually the star of the show. It tasted like Bonchon,
      which is fried twice. The taste is amazing, I didn't even dip it in the sauce provided.</p>
